<h1>SeoulSubway project</h1>

<p>This project implemented the shortest distance and the minimum transfer of Seoul subway line</p>

<p>
Based on C language.

I used low level file I / O to run on Linux.
<p>The TXT file used for file I / O consists of the ID of the current station, the ID of the next station, and the time to the next station.</p>
<p>
Project period February 15 ~ March 15
