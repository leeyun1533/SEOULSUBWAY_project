<h1>SeoulSubway project</h1>

<p>This project implemented the shortest distance and the minimum transfer of Seoul subway line</p>

<p>
Based on C language.
I used low level file I / O to run on Linux.
The TXT file used for file I / O consists of the ID of the current station, the ID of the next station, and the time to the next station.
The project took a month.
